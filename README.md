## Database Structure

### Table Specifications

#### Books Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    isbn VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    publication_date DATE,
    pages INT CHECK (pages > 0),
    total_copies INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 CHECK (total_copies > 0),
    available_copies INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 CHECK (available_copies >= 0),
    category_id INT,
    publisher_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(category_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (publisher_id) REFERENCES publishers(publisher_id)
);
```

#### Members Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE members (
    member_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    member_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    type_id INT NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('Active', 'Suspended', 'Expired', 'Cancelled') DEFAULT 'Active',
    FOREIGN KEY (type_id) REFERENCES member_types(type_id)
);
```

#### Transactions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    member_id INT NOT NULL,
    book_id INT NOT NULL,
    staff_id INT NOT NULL,
    transaction_type ENUM('Borrow', 'Return', 'Renew') NOT NULL,
    transaction_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT (CURRENT_DATE),
    due_date DATE,
    return_date DATE,
    fine_amount DECIMAL(8,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES members(member_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(book_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (staff_id) REFERENCES staff(staff_id)
);
```

## Relationships

### One-to-Many Relationships

**Categories → Books**
- One category can contain many books
- Books can exist without a category (NULL allowed)
- Deleting a category sets book category_id to NULL

**Members → Transactions**
- One member can have many transactions
- Each transaction belongs to exactly one member
- Complete transaction history maintained

**Member Types → Members**
- One membership type applies to many members
- Defines borrowing limits and privileges
- Cannot delete member type while members exist

### Many-to-Many Relationships

**Books ↔ Authors (via book_authors)**
- One book can have multiple authors
- One author can write multiple books
- Junction table stores author roles (Primary Author, Co-Author, Editor, Translator)

### Complex Relationships

**Transaction Management:**
```sql
-- A transaction connects three entities:
member_id → members table (who borrowed)
book_id → books table (what was borrowed)
staff_id → staff table (who processed the transaction)
```

## Constraints & Validation

### Data Integrity Rules

**Books Table:**
- ISBN must be unique and not null
- Available copies cannot exceed total copies
- Page count must be positive
- Both copy counts must be positive numbers

**Members Table:**
- Email addresses must be unique
- Member numbers must be unique
- Membership end date must be after start date (if specified)

**Transactions Table:**
- Return date cannot be before transaction date
- Due date must be after or equal to transaction date
- All foreign key references must exist

### Automatic Validation

**Triggers:**
```sql
-- Automatically decrease available copies when book is borrowed
CREATE TRIGGER borrow_book
AFTER INSERT ON transactions
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF NEW.transaction_type = 'Borrow' THEN
    UPDATE books 
    SET available_copies = available_copies - 1
    WHERE book_id = NEW.book_id AND available_copies > 0;
  END IF;
END
```

## Views & Queries

### Pre-built Views

#### Currently Borrowed Books
```sql
CREATE VIEW currently_borrowed_books AS
SELECT 
    t.transaction_id,
    m.member_number,
    CONCAT(m.first_name, ' ', m.last_name) AS member_name,
    b.title,
    t.due_date,
    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, t.due_date) AS days_overdue
FROM transactions t
JOIN members m ON t.member_id = m.member_id
JOIN books b ON t.book_id = b.book_id
WHERE t.transaction_type = 'Borrow' AND t.return_date IS NULL;
```

#### Book Catalog with Authors
```sql
CREATE VIEW book_catalog AS
SELECT 
    b.book_id,
    b.title,
    GROUP_CONCAT(CONCAT(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name) SEPARATOR ', ') AS authors,
    c.category_name,
    b.available_copies,
    b.total_copies
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN book_authors ba ON b.book_id = ba.book_id
LEFT JOIN authors a ON ba.author_id = a.author_id
LEFT JOIN categories c ON b.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY b.book_id;
```

#### Fine Calculator
```sql
CREATE VIEW fines_due AS
SELECT 
    m.member_number,
    b.title,
    CASE 
        WHEN t.due_date < CURRENT_DATE AND t.return_date IS NULL 
        THEN DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, t.due_date) * mt.fine_per_day
        ELSE 0 
    END AS fine_due
FROM transactions t
JOIN members m ON t.member_id = m.member_id
JOIN books b ON t.book_id = b.book_id
JOIN member_types mt ON m.type_id = mt.type_id;
```

### Useful Queries

**Find available books by category:**
```sql
SELECT b.title, b.available_copies 
FROM books b 
JOIN categories c ON b.category_id = c.category_id 
WHERE c.category_name = 'Fiction' AND b.available_copies > 0;
```

**Member borrowing history:**
```sql
SELECT m.member_number, b.title, t.transaction_date, t.return_date
FROM transactions t
JOIN members m ON t.member_id = m.member_id
JOIN books b ON t.book_id = b.book_id
WHERE m.member_number = 'M001'
ORDER BY t.transaction_date DESC;
```

**Books by author:**
```sql
SELECT b.title, b.publication_date
FROM books b
JOIN book_authors ba ON b.book_id = ba.book_id
JOIN authors a ON ba.author_id = a.author_id
WHERE CONCAT(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name) = 'George Orwell';
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Error Code 1062: Duplicate Entry
**Problem:** Trying to insert duplicate values in unique fields
```
Error Code: 1062. Duplicate entry 'Fiction' for key 'categories.category_name'
```

**Solution:** 
- Use `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS` for clean starts
- Check for existing data before inserting
- Use `INSERT IGNORE` to skip duplicates

#### Error Code 1452: Foreign Key Constraint Failure
**Problem:** Referencing non-existent parent records
```
Error Code: 1452. Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails
```

**Solution:**
- Ensure parent records exist before inserting child records
- Follow correct insertion order: Categories → Publishers → Authors → Books → Members → Transactions
- Verify foreign key values with SELECT queries

#### Error Code 3814: CHECK Constraint Function Restrictions
**Problem:** Using restricted functions in CHECK constraints
```
Error Code: 3814. An expression of a check constraint contains disallowed function: curdate
```

**Solution:**
- Remove problematic CHECK constraints
- Use triggers for complex validation
- Handle date validation at application level

### Debugging Queries

**Check table relationships:**
```sql
SELECT 
    TABLE_NAME,
    COLUMN_NAME,
    CONSTRAINT_NAME,
    REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME,
    REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'library_management_system'
AND REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME IS NOT NULL;
```

**Verify data counts:**
```sql
SELECT 'Books' as table_name, COUNT(*) as records FROM books
UNION ALL SELECT 'Members', COUNT(*) FROM members
UNION ALL SELECT 'Transactions', COUNT(*) FROM transactions;
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Operations

**Add a new book:**
```sql
INSERT INTO books (isbn, title, publication_date, pages, category_id, publisher_id, total_copies, available_copies)
VALUES ('978-0-123-45678-9', 'New Book Title', '2024-01-01', 300, 1, 1, 3, 3);
```

**Register a new member:**
```sql
INSERT INTO members (member_number, first_name, last_name, email, date_of_birth, type_id)
VALUES ('M005', 'New', 'Member', 'new.member@email.com', '1990-01-01', 1);
```

**Process a book loan:**
```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (member_id, book_id, staff_id, transaction_type, due_date)
VALUES (1, 1, 1, 'Borrow', DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 14 DAY));
```

### Advanced Queries

**Most popular books:**
```sql
SELECT b.title, COUNT(t.transaction_id) as borrow_count
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON b.book_id = t.book_id
WHERE t.transaction_type = 'Borrow'
GROUP BY b.book_id
ORDER BY borrow_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Members with overdue books:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT m.member_number, m.first_name, m.last_name, m.email
FROM members m
JOIN transactions t ON m.member_id = t.member_id
WHERE t.due_date < CURRENT_DATE 
AND t.return_date IS NULL 
AND t.transaction_type = 'Borrow';
```
